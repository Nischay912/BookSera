We can group all routes related to authentication under a folder named (auth) as it helps to organize related screens without affecting the URL or route structure.

(app)/(auth)/login.js
(app)/(auth)/register.js
(app)/(main)/home.js
(app)/(main)/profile.js

Route becomes:

/login
/register
/home
/profile

Thus the routes remain unaffected and not becomes something like : /auth/login and all : and thus links are unaffected and all authentication routes gets organized at a single place too here, thus here below.

We can have the folder again have the starting home page for those routes to be named index.jsx , its convention that it will be the starting home page for that folder related to auth grouped in it ; and its different from the default home index.jsx page we had in root directory of "app" there.

And then we can get the basic boilerplate for each using the shortcut "rnfe" > ENTER : now there in each of them.

See the next steps in _layout.jsx file of (auth) folder now there.
