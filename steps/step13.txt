We will be using the MONGODB database > go on mongodb.com > create new project "BookSera" > next > create.

Create new cluster > free plan > create deployment > copy the password and then create database user > choose a connection string > drivers > copy the connection string > paste in .env file > but by default database name becomes "test" ; so to change it : we must do there in connection string as : after "mongodb.net/" we will put : mongodb.net/BookSera?... > gets the name "BookSera" to database now.

Go in network access > ip access list > add ip address > allow access from anywhere > confirm.

This is done because : When you use MongoDB Atlas (cloud MongoDB), by default all network access is blocked for security. MongoDB does this to protect your database from unauthorized access.

But when we did this now : Allow connection from any IP address on the internet ; its needed because : Your Node.js / Python / Java / frontend app runs from your system, and it needs to connect to MongoDB. If MongoDB is blocking your system’s IP, your app cannot connect.

SO, adding the IP address like this : Allows that device/server to connect to the MongoDB cluster.

What does Allow access from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) mean?

It means MongoDB is open to all IPs.
This is easy while developing because your IP might change or you're using multiple devices.

But : Allowing 0.0.0.0/0 is not secure. It allows everyone on the internet to attempt access ; better to keep our own pc and trusted pc ip address only there ; or : Or allow only your server’s public IP ; but for now lets keep like that only there.

See the next steps in db.js file now there.
