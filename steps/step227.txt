Now : the "app" folder there is the main special folder, all the files placed there, becomes the screens for our application there ; in web dev they were called web pages, but here in mobile app, we have screens ; like the default first screen we see is the index.tsx screen, thus here below.

"index.tsx" is the convention for our homepage there ; even if we had another folder "auth" inside "app" > still we will have "index.tsx" file inside that folder as the entry point or starting screen for that older too ; thus this is a convention to keep index.tsx as starting home screen for any app thus here below , whenever we have nested routes there.

The layout file there is also a special file, that we will see about in detail later now there.

Change all ".tsx" in "app" folder as we will be using JavaScript and not TypeScript here in our/ for our project.

Now, in react native ; whenever we have a text to be written, we should use : <Text> , else if we just write a text there without wrapping in <Text> component, then it will give error.

Also we can have a object with the styles in the style field of any element like View , Text, etc : like present in the index.jsx file.

Example : <Text style = {{color: "red"}}>Hello</Text>

But adding so many styles like this for each component can make the file very long and un-manageable, so lets create a stylesheet to keep all the styles at one place there now.

we have a StyleSheet from react-native which helps us to keep all the styles in one place now there ; so if we make like -

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center"
    },
    title: {
        color: "red"
    }
})

; then we can use it in components like -

<View style={styles.container}> and <Text style={styles.title}> there.

Now : we can install : cd mobile > "npx expo install expo-image" > and then we can use the Image component from expo-image in our file whenever needed there now ; and the Image from expo than the Image fro react native is that the expo-image vala is a lot more optimized as it allows to use many different options in the cache too there.

So, we can use it like : <Image cachePolicy={""} /> : and then we can hover over it to see when to use which option as it lets us decide where to save the file based on our need there.

Then we can do : <Image source={uri: ""} /> -> do like this if we are importing the image from a remote website ot something ; but if importing image from a local file of pc , we do : <Image source={require("")} /> and then we put the complete path of the image saved in the folder lets say in the images folder under the assets folder there ; so we need to mention its complete path thus there.

See the next steps now in colors.js file now there.
