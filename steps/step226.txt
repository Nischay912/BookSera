Now lets try to initialize our React Native application using EXPO > go on "expo.dev" > read the docs there.

Open terminal > cd .\mobile > (can type "cd" and then keep pressing tab one by one till get required directory name there) > then do : "npx create-expo-app@latest ." paste in terminal > we added "space" followed by "." as we want to initialize all the things of that expo inside the current folder/directory i.e. under "mobile" folder only ; not outside creating new folder , thats why added extra "." thus now there.

Then we can delete the default files that come there y typing : "npm run reset-project" and then "n" there in terminal if asked to create an example of it there.

To run this on physical phone > "npx expo" > scan qr code there ; and to run on simulator , press "a" to run the app in the android simulator app of laptop ; press "i" in macbooks if there.

Anytime to refresh the app and bundle again press "r" in terminal anytime too there.

Can press "w" in terminal to run the app on webpage too > and then go in inspect and set the device name there in responsiveness to see there the look of webpage version in any specific device now there ; but we don't want this as we want to do on apps and not webpage design there.

Now can edit the <Text> in index.tsx file to see real-time changes in physical phone or the android simulator too there ; to verify that yes the app is running properly and working now there ; thus here below.

See the next steps in step227.txt file now there.
