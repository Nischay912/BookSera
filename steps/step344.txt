Now : we can make the changes in terminal > cd backend > git add . > git commit -m "cron added and implemented" > git push.

Then redeploy on render.com , though no need as since we logged in via github ; it auto re-deploys the web service everytime new commits and push are done in that repository there.

But also add the API_URL variable that we used in cron.js file with value equal to the live link from rendr in the environment variables section there on render.com now there.

So : now every 14 minutes a GET request will be sent to the deployed api , keeping it active all the time, thus here below.

And also include API_URL in the .env of file here to prveent errors in temrinal and also use dotenv package there as by rule if we want to use env variables in a file ; we must import dotenv and use its dotenv.config() method always first there on the top there, thus here below.

However when running the app on simulator and not physical phone no need to use this deployed API and put pressure on server by making request continously ther e; rather use http://10.0.2.2:3000/api/auth/register for AVD android simulator devices by rule learnt earlier now there.

See the next steps in index.jsx file of the root app directory folder now there.
