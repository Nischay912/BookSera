Now : in _layout.tsx file there > we have a Stack navigator there.

In react native , we have many different navigators > Tab navigator is the one present at bottom of the screen that is used to see the different screens there based on the current selected tab there.

Then the Stack navigator is a navigator that acts like a stack, where new tabs comes form right side and we can go to previous slides there by clicking on back button & the previous slides comes from the left side there.

This is done by help of the <Stack > navigator we are using in the _layout.tsx file now there.

If there we do : <Stack screenOptions = {{  headerShown: false }} /> : then the header coming based on file name on each page will stop coming there now.

If we want to have the header shown but want to rename it then we can do as follows there -

<Stack screenOptions = {{  headerShown: false }}>
    <Stack.screen name="index" options={{ title: "Home" }} />
</Stack>

The name of screen should match the file name i.e. it was index.jsx so keep it "index" and then add new name in options like done here below.

See the next steps in index.jsx file now there.
