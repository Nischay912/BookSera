So now : after changing backend also, no changes seen there, its probably because : we didn't logout and login again ; its because the user data is stored in AsyncStorage once logged in, so to update the Async Storage we need to logout and login back, because : App → still using OLD saved data from AsyncStorag ; so when we logout, then AsyncStorage will remove the item "user" , and so on login again, new data fetched from backend with createdAt too in it, which then visible on the profile screen membership date there, thus here below.

AsyncStorage = Offline cache (local copy) ; so AsyncStorage not updates with change in backend directly ; needs to update the stored item there, so for that we re-login to delete the previous old data and new fresh data for the "user" set back in to be used with createdAt in it, thus here below.

See the next steps in LogoutButton.jsx file now there.
