JWT_SECRET is used as the key to sign JWTs and to verify their authenticity (for symmetric algorithms like HS256) ; If an attacker obtains the secret they can forge valid tokens and impersonate users ; your server uses the secret to ensure incoming tokens were issued by your service and not tampered with ; 

Now, we had made the JWT_SECRET in env file as a random secret by ourselves for now there "my_secret" ; but if hacker gets this secret , he can get the access to jwt tokens management and can get himself authenticated inot other's account easily there using jwt tokens ; so better to make a better secret there in the .env file for it there.

So, for that > open terminal > click on + and create a new terminal there > make it "bash" using the drop down next to the "+" button there > type : "openssl rand -base64 32" .

This command generates a random secret key (32 bytes of randomness) and encodes it in Base64 ; Base64 is a way of encoding data so it can be safely stored or transmitted as plain text.It converts binary data into text using only: A–Z, a–z, 0–9, +, / ; so : You usually run this to create a strong JWT secret, session secret, or encryption key ; Base64 ensures the secret is only text characters, so it’s easy to store in .env files and environment variables, without breaking formatting.

The strength of your JWT authentication depends on the secrecy of this key.
If someone gets this secret, they can generate valid JWTs and impersonate users — that’s why the secret must stay private.
